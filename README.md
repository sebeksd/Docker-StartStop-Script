# Docker Stert/Stop script #


# README #

## Description ##
Script to stop running containers and then start them without starting containers that were already stopped.

Example situation to use this script is when we want to create backup of files and we want to stop containrs during that process, 
after backup is complete we want to start same containers without containers that were stopped before.

## Additional options ##
 -stop - will stop running containers and save them to a list\
 -restart - will start containers previously stopped by this script\
 -h, --help - show help
